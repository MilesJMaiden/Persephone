Fully Customizable L-System Renderer - PERSEPHONE

This repository contains the source code and assets for a fully customizable L-System renderer, inspired by Aristid Lindenmayer's work in algorithmic botany. The tool enables the creation and visualization of plant-like structures with an emphasis on user interactivity, performance optimization, and scalability.

Features:
Interactive UI: Adjust axiom, rules, angles, lengths, and iteration counts in real-time.
Stochastic L-Systems: Introduce randomness to simulate natural growth patterns.
Dynamic Pruning: Click to remove branches and watch the plant adapt dynamically.
Unity Optimization: Built with Unityâ€™s Job System and Burst Compiler for high performance.
Preset Models: Includes 14 configurations, including six classic deterministic models.
Expandable: Designed with SOLID principles to facilitate future extensions, such as 3D rendering and adaptive L-Systems.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Open the project in Unity (tested with version 2021.X or later).
Explore or modify the preset configurations, or create your own!
Run the scene and experiment with the adjustable parameters and real-time rendering.
Applications:
Game Development: Procedural foliage for immersive worlds.
Education: Demonstrates principles of fractals and algorithmic botany.
Art: Create unique procedural art pieces with infinite variability.
Research: Test advanced procedural generation techniques.
